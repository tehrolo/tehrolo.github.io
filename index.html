					<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
						<p>In this tutorial, you will learn about Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML.</p>
						<p>Webpages are created using HTML, which is an authoring language used to
							create documents for the web. HTML consists of a set of spe- cial instructions called
							tags to define the structure and layout of content in a webpage. A browser reads the
							HTML tags to determine how to display the webpage content on a screen.</p>

					<h3>Your First Webpage</h3>
						<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to create your first web- page.</p>
						<p>You can create webpages using HTML with a simple text editor, such as
							Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime, Programmerâ€™s Notepad, TextEdit, and TextWrangler.
							Notepad comes preinstalled with the Windows oper- ating system and TextEdit
							comes preinstalled with the Mac OS X op- erating system. TextWrangler also runs
							only on Mac OS X, while the other text editors run on Windows. A text editor is a
							program that allows you to enter, change, save, and print text, which includes HTML
							tags.</p>
